## **Description**
This app was inspired by a group project in which we had to tackle a social issue.
Thus we designed a application for people who want to learn the basics of proper nutrition and discover resources to help them meet their nutritional needs. It ensures that everyone has equal access to whole, healthy foods.

  *Disclaimer this application is made entirely for the purpose of our group project. We are not suggesting to follow all the recommendations. Please consult a nutrionist for advice .*
